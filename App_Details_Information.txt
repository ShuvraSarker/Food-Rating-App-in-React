This food rating app basically has two js files one is App.js and another is UpDownVote.js. In App.js there is a array function where all items are taken.There is a onClickfunction for adding the items. When someone click Add This Item the function will take the new items to the array and push it. There is also a Toggle function to show/hide the table. In UpDownvote.js file i have taken another component to Increment and Decrement existing items vote. I have taken a button onClick function and this.state.clicks for incrementing and decrementing the numbers.Thanks.
